However, many complex microbial interactions dictate community dynamics and stability that must be replicated in synthetic systems. The rumen and/or hindguts of large mammalian herbivores harbor complex communities of biomass-degrading fungi and bacteria, as well as archaea and protozoa that work collectively to degrade lignocellulose, yet the microbial interactions responsible for stability, resilience, and activity of the community remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we demonstrate a ‚Äútop-down‚Äù enrichment-based methodology for selecting a minimal but effective lignocellulose-degrading community that produces methane-rich fermentation gas (biogas). The resulting enrichment consortium produced 0.75‚Äì1.9-fold more fermentation gas at 1.4‚Äì2.1 times the rate compared to a monoculture of fungi from the enrichment. Metagenomic sequencing of the top-down enriched consortium revealed genomes encoding for functional compartmentalization of the community, spread across an anaerobic fungus (Piromyces), a bacterium (Sphaerochaeta), and two methanogenic archaea (Methanosphaera and Methanocorpusculum). Guided by the composition of the top-down enrichment, several synthetic cocultures were formed from the ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù using previously isolated fungi, Neocallimastix californiae and Anaeromyces robustus paired with the methanogen Methanobacterium bryantii. While cross-feeding occurred in synthetic co-cultures, removal of fungal metabolites by methanogens did not increase the rate of gas production or the rate of substrate deconstruction by the synthetic community relative to fungal monocultures. Metabolomic characterization verified that syntrophy was established within synthetic co-cultures, which generated methane at similar concentrations compared to the enriched consortium but lacked the temporal stability (resilience) seen in the native system. Taken together, deciphering the membership and metabolic potential of an enriched gut consortium enables the design of methanogenic synthetic co-cultures. However, differences in the growth rate and stability of enriched versus synthetic consortia underscore the difficulties in mimicking naturally occurring syntrophy in synthetic systems.","tags":[""],"title":"Top-down enrichment guides in formation of synthetic microbial consortia for biomass degradation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Long-read sequencing technologies have led to a rapid rise in the number of high-quality sequenced fungal genomes and transcriptomes available for study. This information, coupled with bioinformatic analyses, allows access to a striking variety of potential genes to target for downstream characterization and incorporation into bioproduction strategies. However, nonmodel organisms are notoriously difficult to cultivate and genetically modify, limiting the speed at which in silico discoveries can be tested and translated into application. It is critical to combine sequencing information and systems biology to guide both genetic engineering and heterologous expression strategies to harness the biotech potential of nonmodel fungi. This review highlights recent examples where bioinformatics was used to identify genes and pathways of interest that were later exploited to produce biotechnologically important secondary metabolites, transporters, and lignocellulose-active enzymes. We also highlight opportunities where modern approaches, such as genome-scale models and genome editing, may be used to rapidly improve our understanding of nonmodel fungi and fully exploit them for synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Linking ‚Äòomics‚Äô to function unlocks the biotech potential of non-model fungi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I.

The most abundant bacteria in the ocean are oligotrophs, which probably grow more slowly than those bacteria whose rRNA:rDNA versus growth rate relationships are known. To examine whether rRNA:rDNA varies differently in oligotrophic marine bacteria than in copiotrophic bacteria, we used quantitative PCR and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR to measure rRNA:rDNA in two marine copiotrophs and in two marine oligotrophs, including Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062, a coastal isolate of SAR11, the most abundant bacterial clade in the ocean. The rRNA:rDNA ratios for the two copiotrophs were similar to those expected on the basis of an analysis of previously studied copiotrophic bacteria, while the ratios for the two oligotrophs were substantially lower than predicted even given their slow growth rates. The rRNA:rDNA ratios determined along a transect in the Delaware estuary suggested that SAR11 bacteria grow at rates close to the growth rate in culture, while rates of the two copiotrophs were far below those observed in laboratory cultures. Our results have implications for interpreting rRNA:rDNA from natural communities, understanding growth strategies and comparing regulatory mechanisms in copiotrophs and oligotrophs.","tags":[""],"title":"Growth rates and rRNA content of four marine bacteria in pure cultures and in the Delaware estuary","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
