I am a PhD student in the [O'Malley Lab](http://www.omalleylab.com/) at UC Santa Barbara where we engineer non-model organisms, enzymes, and microbial communities. My overarching scientific interest is in synthetic biology of non-model organisms and the goal of my research is to inform and expand what microbes can do to improve human sustainability. In practice, this means that I am very interested in biological processes that can be coopted for human purposes. The ingenuity and elegance of biology is amazing to me and could hold solutions to novel drugs, processes, and materials. I spend a lot of time thinking about how basic biological understanding of organisms with useful innovations will improve and enhance biotechnology. It is my perspective that only by further describing these biological phenomena will we be able to engineer them in the future. In this way, I see basic biology and biological engineering as close partners in this process of advancing biotechnology.
 
A main focus of my dissertation research is lignocellulosic biorefinery processes, specifically biologically mediated lignin deconstruction. Lignocellulosic biorefineries envision that commodity chemicals can one day be sourced from plants rather than petroleum. In partnership with the [Joint BioEnergy Institute](http://www.jbei.org) (JBEI), I prospect for novel ligninolytic enzymes in single celled anaerobic fungi that we find in the digestive tracts of large herbivores. These enzymes will help with biorefinery processes by breaking down lignin into manageable pieces that can be reassembled into valuable products. Lignin chemistry is aromatic making it especially well-suited to creating products like carbon fibers, bioplastics, flame retardant coatings, and flavorings.
 
My background and training prior to joining the Oâ€™Malley Lab was in biogeochemistry and environmental microbiology. Microbes shaped and continue to shape the world around us. Life began microbially, and microbial processes form the chemical gradients around us now. Taken all together this makes microbes an ideal platform to not only increase the utility of biology to humans, but to build knowledge of some of the most important questions in science such as: What is the origin of life on earth? How unique is life on earth in the cosmos? And how does feedback between the abiotic universe and life shape - or not shape - the cosmos?
