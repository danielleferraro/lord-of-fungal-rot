The lignocellulosic biorefinery is the concept that we can use rapidly growing plants as a feedstock, or chemical starting point, and then transform these plants into valuable products through various processes. Lignin, the chemically aromatic third of the plant cell wall, is essential to biorefinery processes as lignin can theoretically be converted into bioplastics, coatings, flavorings, and carbon fibers with high monetary value. The old adage that was once tossed around is “you can make anything from lignin, except money,” but our understanding of lignin chemistry and biology has rapidly imparted viability to ideas that were once impossible. A fully functional lignin valorization pipeline has the potential to replace demand for petroleum molecules like *p*-xylene. Growing our chemicals in the ground instead of pumping them out of the ground could have positive impacts on everything from climate change, to landfill usage, to our wallets. 

My work focuses on lignin deconstruction which is the first step in lignin valorization and involves producing chemical precursors for the valuable products from intact plant cell walls. Solubilization of lignin provides precursors for lignin-derived chemicals and also allows other enzymes to better break down the other parts of the plant cell wall. Since there are currently no described ligninolytic enzyme systems that work in the absence of molecular oxygen, I hope to be able to describe new enzymes that break down lignin in entirely new ways.
