Microbes have biological machinery, also known as enzymes, that facilitate chemical reactions. Chemical reactions facilitated by enzymes could synthesize valuable molecules, or could help with other processes of interest like the hydrolysis of lignocellulose. In some cases we hope to find enzymes that catalyze reactions that are currently not known to take place in nature. Anaerobes have gotten a reputation as being inefficient fermenters, or evolutionarily primitive in some introductory biology textbooks. But some anaerobes are in fact highly efficient at obtaining energy from their environment. Additionally, some anaerobes seem to have devised clever ways of facilitating chemical reactions, that usually require oxygen, in its absence.

My research particularly focuses on under-described anaerobic gut fungi (AGF) and how they facilitate chemical reactions under reducing chemical conditions in the absence of oxygen. I have two main lines of inquiry in my work. First, I want to discover how the AGF break down lignin in the absence of oxygen. The enzymes that carry out this process have potential to be useful in lignocellulosic biorefinery applications. Secondly I also seek to discover undescribed enzymes that participate in anaerobic energy conservation. These enzymes could be of use to researchers that seek to engineer efficient anaerobic biology, and are of great interest to basic biological research.
