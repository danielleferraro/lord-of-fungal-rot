Novel or under-described microbes have uncharacterized biological machinery, also known as enzymes, that facilitate new chemical reactions. My research particularly focuses on under-described anaerobic single celled fungi and how they facilitate chemical reactions under reducing chemical conditions in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobes have gotten a bad wrap in some introductory biology textbooks as ‘inefficient fermenters,’ but they are in fact highly efficient at obtaining energy from their environment. Additionally, some anaerobes seem to have devised clever ways of facilitating chemical reactions, that usually require oxygen, in its absence.
