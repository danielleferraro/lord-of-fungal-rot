Non-model microbes are those that are underdescribed and undercharacterized when compared to model microbes such as E. coli and brewerâ€™s yeast. The development of microbial ecology as a field led to the discovery that microbes are not only all around us, but are diverse beyond our collective imaginations. This broad diversity is an opportunity to discover and describe novel microbes that could possess the capacity to facilitate chemical reactions that are useful to humans.
