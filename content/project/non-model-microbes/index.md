The left-hand side of the image shows a helium ion microscopy image of an anaerobic fungus overlaid on a drawing of its host organism, a goat. The right-hand side of the screen depicts the non-model lifecycle of the anaerobic fungi. The lifecycle is one factor that differentiates anaerobic fungi from model organisms.'

  Non-model microbes are those that are under described and under characterized when compared to model microbes such as *E. coli* and *S. cerevisiae*. The development of microbial ecology as a field led to the discovery that microbes are not only all around us, but are diverse beyond our collective imaginations. This broad diversity is an opportunity to discover and describe novel microbes that could possess the capacity to facilitate chemical reactions that are useful to humans.  

  I work on non-model organisms known as the anaerobic gut fungi (AGF), which are the descendants of aerobic fungi and all belong to the phylum Neocallimastigomycota. The AGF are effective degraders of biomass and their genomes possess more genes for breaking down lignocellulose than the genome of any other organism. Despite the enzymatic superiority of the AGF only 30% of genes in AGF genomes can be assigned a function. This plus their incompletely described biology make them a non-model microbial system.
