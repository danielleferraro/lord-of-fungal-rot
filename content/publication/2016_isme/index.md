abstract: Interpretation of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to 16S rRNA gene ratios (rRNA:rDNA) is based on a limited number of studies with rapidly growing copiotrophic bacteria. The most abundant bacteria in the ocean are oligotrophs, which probably grow more slowly than those bacteria whose rRNA:rDNA versus growth rate relationships are known. To examine whether rRNA:rDNA varies differently in oligotrophic marine bacteria than in copiotrophic bacteria, we used quantitative PCR and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR to measure rRNA:rDNA in two marine copiotrophs and in two marine oligotrophs, including Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique HTCC1062, a coastal isolate of SAR11, the most abundant bacterial clade in the ocean. The rRNA:rDNA ratios for the two copiotrophs were similar to those expected on the basis of an analysis of previously studied copiotrophic bacteria, while the ratios for the two oligotrophs were substantially lower than predicted even given their slow growth rates. The rRNA:rDNA ratios determined along a transect in the Delaware estuary suggested that SAR11 bacteria grow at rates close to the growth rate in culture, while rates of the two copiotrophs were far below those observed in laboratory cultures. Our results have implications for interpreting rRNA:rDNA from natural communities, understanding growth strategies and comparing regulatory mechanisms in copiotrophs and oligotrophs.
