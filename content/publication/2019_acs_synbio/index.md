abstract: Consortium-based approaches are a promising avenue toward efficient bioprocessing. However, many complex microbial interactions dictate community dynamics and stability that must be replicated in synthetic systems. The rumen and/or hindguts of large mammalian herbivores harbor complex communities of biomass-degrading fungi and bacteria, as well as archaea and protozoa that work collectively to degrade lignocellulose, yet the microbial interactions responsible for stability, resilience, and activity of the community remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we demonstrate a “top-down” enrichment-based methodology for selecting a minimal but effective lignocellulose-degrading community that produces methane-rich fermentation gas (biogas). The resulting enrichment consortium produced 0.75–1.9-fold more fermentation gas at 1.4–2.1 times the rate compared to a monoculture of fungi from the enrichment. Metagenomic sequencing of the top-down enriched consortium revealed genomes encoding for functional compartmentalization of the community, spread across an anaerobic fungus (Piromyces), a bacterium (Sphaerochaeta), and two methanogenic archaea (Methanosphaera and Methanocorpusculum). Guided by the composition of the top-down enrichment, several synthetic cocultures were formed from the “bottom-up” using previously isolated fungi, Neocallimastix californiae and Anaeromyces robustus paired with the methanogen Methanobacterium bryantii. While cross-feeding occurred in synthetic co-cultures, removal of fungal metabolites by methanogens did not increase the rate of gas production or the rate of substrate deconstruction by the synthetic community relative to fungal monocultures. Metabolomic characterization verified that syntrophy was established within synthetic co-cultures, which generated methane at similar concentrations compared to the enriched consortium but lacked the temporal stability (resilience) seen in the native system. Taken together, deciphering the membership and metabolic potential of an enriched gut consortium enables the design of methanogenic synthetic co-cultures. However, differences in the growth rate and stability of enriched versus synthetic consortia underscore the difficulties in mimicking naturally occurring syntrophy in synthetic systems.
